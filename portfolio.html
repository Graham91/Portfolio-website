                Developer Story:
            </h3>
            <p>I am a creator. I have a bachelors in studio art. Unlike the typical studio art student I
                spent
                the
                majority of college career studing and using the many relevant technologies. I love CNC
                machining,3d
                printing, 3d modeling and 3D scanning. They
                allow me to take my natural gifts and implement them in exciting new ways. In my first
                sculpture
                class we learned how to carve stone. 20 hours of hitting a rock with a stick pushed me into
                the
                arms
                of technology, starting a love affair that
                I just coudln't shake. I had no reason to code at this time, but I knew if something could
                be
                done
                better or easier, I wasn't about to waste my time doing it the long way.
            </p>
            <p>in the more recent past I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At
                the
                time they were building 3d models of peoples homes using aeiral imagery. the modeling aspect
                combined with the fact that my wife worked in the building
                made this job ideal. What I didnt know when i took the job is that it would introduce me to
                a
                whole
                new world of tools.
            </p>
            <p> I have an extremely analitical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for
                my
                ablitity to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programing, on a surface level of
                course. I
                was move to the PA testing department which was
                like a less knowledgable QA position. It was here were I got to interact with developers and
                find
                out what ws happening behind the scenes. I realized that while the testing department had
                more
                information that the rest of the PA's it was still
                in the dark about most things. developers were talked about in reverent tones like they were
                gods or
                something. I decided i simply couldn't stand for it and my idea for indepth comprehsive
                documentation of how the system worked was born. My
                intent was to give the testers enough information that they would be better able to pinpoint
                a
                problem after running a few test. My team lead agreed it would be a benificial project, so I
                began.
                I started looking thorugh confusing flow charts
                and reaching out to different departments to compile the documentation.
            </p>
            <p> It was fun and Although I was getting praised left and right for this initiative, to get our
                highly
                skilled group of production analyst out of the dark absis of program ingorance, I had a
                secret.
                I'm
                going to let you in on it; even though I had
                everyone convinced that I was just this heroic documentor, I had another selfish purpose
                entirely. I
                have this sort of insatiable desire to understand things. I just wanted to know how it
                worked,
                because I was curious.
            </p>
            <p> Well about a month add a half in, our company got hit with a pretty serious patent
                infridgement
                halting all our production, and I got layed off with about 40 of my coworkers. So it was
                time to
                reevalute but unlike when I started school, a decade
                before, I knew something I didn't back then. Coding was no longer this ambigous monster the
                nerds
                lorded over me, bless them. Please don't think I'm prejuduce, I just had the opertunity to
                grow
                up
                in the shadow of a brother who was scary smart,
                but thanks to that job though, I now know that scary was just unknown. Coding had been
                demystified.
                As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place for me, I realized that What I had
                been
                chasing at my job was a developers undestanding.
                So as soon as I could I signed up for a bootcamp and got started. </p>
            <p>
                Turns out coding is a ton of fun. I welcome the added ablitity to create and streamline the
                things I
                value. If michelangelo or da vinci were alive today, you can bet your socks, they would not
                be
                hitting rocks with sticks and mixing colors on a palete.
                Fingers in the dirt are for enjoying a sandy beach and picking carrots not for doing things
                the
                hard
                way. Life should be easy and it should only get easier.</p>
            <h3> Personal Crest: Albatross- symbolizes ultimate freedom.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The albatross is truly the master
                of
                the sea. With wings spanning up to 11 feet long, an adult albatross can travel 10,000 miles
                in a
                single journey and circumnavigating the globe in just 46 days. These emperors of the sky,
                while
                spend their time flying over the most beautiful vistas on this planet, embody absolute
                freedom
                and yet they also mate for life. True freedom is the ability to choose and want your choice.
                I included this because I wanted to explain why there is a bird in the design. I actually did
                all the art work for this site myself.

            <div class="siteTitle">NBA Sports center</div>
            <P>
                This site began as joint class project, however it has changed
                so
                much recently that it is basically almost all my work. The initial
                idea
                was to create a sports dashboard where NBA fans could keep up
                with
                their favorite teams and players. This was our first full stack
                project, and because of the nervousness of the others in my
                group I
                was tasked with the entire backend as well as most all the
                communication back and forth. They just did front end design
                stuff
                and one of the API’s that is still being utilized although it
                has
                been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                site
                myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                responsive
                visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                information
                gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s.
            </P>
            <p>
                The site is not complete, several of the API’s are not all
                together
                and working though they are close. I decided to include it here
                though because the UI is so cool. I designed and coded all of it
                myself and I am immensely proud of the way it looks and
                responds.
                Once you have signed into the site If you change the last
                integer in
                the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                not
                ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                off
                the app’s versatility.

                                                        much recently that it is basically almost all my work. The
                                                        initial
                                                        idea
                                                        was to create a sports dashboard where NBA fans could keep up
                                                        with
                                                        their favorite teams and players. This was our first full stack
                                                        project, and because of the nervousness of the others in my
                                                        group I
                                                        was tasked with the entire backend as well as most all the
                                                        communication back and forth. They just did front end design
                                                        stuff
                                                        and one of the API’s that is still being utilized although it
                                                        has
                                                        been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                                                        site
                                                        myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                                                        responsive
                                                        visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                                                        information
                                                        gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s.

                                                        The site is not complete, several of the API’s are not all
                                                        together
                                                        and working though they are close. I decided to include it here
                                                        though because the UI is so cool. I designed and coded all of it
                                                        myself and I am immensely proud of the way it looks and
                                                        responds.
                                                        Once you have signed into the site If you change the last
                                                        integer in
                                                        the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                                                        not
                                                        ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                                                        first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                                                        off
                                                        the app’s versatility.

                                                and one of the API’s that is still being utilized although it
                                                has
                                                been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                                                site
                                                myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                                                responsive
                                                visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                                                information
                                                gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s.

                                                The site is not complete, several of the API’s are not all
                                                together
                                                and working though they are close. I decided to include it here
                                                though because the UI is so cool. I designed and coded all of it
                                                myself and I am immensely proud of the way it looks and
                                                responds.
                                                Once you have signed into the site If you change the last

                                                the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                                                not
                                                ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                                                first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                                                off
                                                the app’s versatility.

                        Developer Story:
                    </h3>
                    <p>I am a creator. I have a bachelors in studio art. Unlike the typical studio art student I
                        spent
                        the
                        majority of college career studing and using the many relevant technologies. I love CNC
                        machining,3d
                        printing, 3d modeling and 3D scanning. They
                        allow me to take my natural gifts and implement them in exciting new ways. In my first
                        sculpture
                        class we learned how to carve stone. 20 hours of hitting a rock with a stick pushed me into
                        the
                        arms
                        of technology, starting a love affair that
                        I just coudln't shake. I had no reason to code at this time, but I knew if something could
                        be
                        done
                        better or easier, I wasn't about to waste my time doing it the long way.
                    </p>
                    <p>in the more recent past I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At
                        the
                        time they were building 3d models of peoples homes using aeiral imagery. the modeling aspect
                        combined with the fact that my wife worked in the building
                        made this job ideal. What I didnt know when i took the job is that it would introduce me to
                        a
                        whole
                        new world of tools.
                    </p>
                    <p> I have an extremely analitical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for
                        my
                        ablitity to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programing, on a surface level of
                        course. I
                        was move to the PA testing department which was
                        like a less knowledgable QA position. It was here were I got to interact with developers and
                        find
                        out what ws happening behind the scenes. I realized that while the testing department had
                        more
                        information that the rest of the PA's it was still
                        in the dark about most things. developers were talked about in reverent tones like they were
                        gods or
                        something. I decided i simply couldn't stand for it and my idea for indepth comprehsive
                        documentation of how the system worked was born. My
                        intent was to give the testers enough information that they would be better able to pinpoint
                        a
                        problem after running a few test. My team lead agreed it would be a benificial project, so I
                        began.
                        I started looking thorugh confusing flow charts
                        and reaching out to different departments to compile the documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p> It was fun and Although I was getting praised left and right for this initiative, to get our
                        highly
                        skilled group of production analyst out of the dark absis of program ingorance, I had a
                        secret.
                        I'm
                        going to let you in on it; even though I had
                        everyone convinced that I was just this heroic documentor, I had another selfish purpose
                        entirely. I
                        have this sort of insatiable desire to understand things. I just wanted to know how it
                        worked,
                        because I was curious.
                    </p>
                    <p> Well about a month add a half in, our company got hit with a pretty serious patent
                        infridgement
                        halting all our production, and I got layed off with about 40 of my coworkers. So it was
                        time to
                        reevalute but unlike when I started school, a decade
                        before, I knew something I didn't back then. Coding was no longer this ambigous monster the
                        nerds
                        lorded over me, bless them. Please don't think I'm prejuduce, I just had the opertunity to
                        grow
                        up
                        in the shadow of a brother who was scary smart,
                        but thanks to that job though, I now know that scary was just unknown. Coding had been
                        demystified.
                        As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place for me, I realized that What I had
                        been
                        chasing at my job was a developers undestanding.
                        So as soon as I could I signed up for a bootcamp and got started. </p>
                    <p>
                        Turns out coding is a ton of fun. I welcome the added ablitity to create and streamline the
                        things I
                        value. If michelangelo or da vinci were alive today, you can bet your socks, they would not
                        be
                        hitting rocks with sticks and mixing colors on a palete.
                        Fingers in the dirt are for enjoying a sandy beach and picking carrots not for doing things
                        the
                        hard
                        way. Life should be easy and it should only get easier.</p>
                    <h3> Personal Crest: Albatross- symbolizes ultimate freedom.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The albatross is truly the master
                        of
                        the sea. With wings spanning up to 11 feet long, an adult albatross can travel 10,000 miles
                        in a
                        single journey and circumnavigating the globe in just 46 days. These emperors of the sky,
                        while
                        spend their time flying over the most beautiful vistas on this planet, embody absolute
                        freedom
                        and yet they also mate for life. True freedom is the ability to choose and want your choice.
                        I included this because I wanted to explain why there is a bird in the design. I actually did
                        all the art work for this site myself.
