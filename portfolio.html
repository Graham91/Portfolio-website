                Developer Story:
            </h3>
            <p>I am a creator. I have a bachelors in studio art. Unlike the typical studio art student, I spent
                the majority of college career studying and using many relevant technologies. I love CNC
                machining, 3d printing, 3d modeling and 3D scanning. They allow me to take my natural gifts and
                implement them in exciting new ways. In my first sculpture class we learned how to carve stone.
                20 hours of hitting a rock with a stick pushed me into the arms of technology. I had no reason
                to code at this time, but I knew if my art could be done in a better or easier way, I was not
                about to waste my time for the sake of tradition.
            </p>
            <p>In the more recent past I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At the
                time they were building 3d models of homes using aerial imagery. the modeling aspect combined
                with the fact that my wife worked in the building made this job ideal. What I didn’t know when I
                took the job is that it would introduce me to a whole new world of tools.
            </p>
            <p>I have an extremely analytical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for my
                ability to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programing at a surface level. I was
                move to the PA testing department which was a manual testing position. It was here that I got to
                interact with developers and find out what was happening behind the scenes. I realized that
                while the testing department had more information that the rest of the PA's we were still in the
                dark about most things. Developers were talked about in reverent tones. I decided I was tired of
                being in the dark. With that, my idea for in depth comprehensive documentation of how the system
                worked was born. My intent was to give the testers enough information that they would be better
                able to pinpoint a problem after running a few tests. My team lead agreed it would be a
                beneficial project, so I began. I started looking through confusing flow charts and reaching out
                to different departments to compile the documentation.
            </p>
            <p> It was fun and although I was getting praised left and right for gathering and documenting, I
                had a secret. Even though I had everyone convinced that I was just a heroic documenter, I had
                another selfish purpose entirely. I have this insatiable desire to understand things. I wanted
                to know how it worked, because I was curious.
            </p>
            <p> About a month and a half in, under unfortunate circumstances I was laid off with about 40 of my
                coworkers. It was time to reevaluate.
                But unlike when I started school, a decade before, I knew something I didn't back then; coding
                was no longer this ambiguous monster. I now knew that it was just a skill set like any other.
                Coding had been demystified. As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place, I realized
                that what I had been chasing at my job was a developer’s understanding. As soon as I could, I
                signed up for a bootcamp and got started.</p>
            <p>
                As it turns out, I really enjoyed learning to code and look forward to learning more. I welcome
                the added ability to create and streamline the things I value. If Michelangelo or da Vinci were
                alive today, you can bet your socks they would not be hitting rocks with sticks and mixing
                colors on a palette. Fingers in the dirt are for enjoying a sandy beach and picking carrots, not
                for doing things as if we were born a thousand years ago. Technology makes life easier, and I
                look forward to participating in its expansion. </p>
            <h3> Personal Crest: Albatross- symbolizes ultimate freedom.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The albatross is truly the master
                of
                the sea. With wings spanning up to 11 feet long, an adult albatross can travel 10,000 miles
                in a
                single journey and circumnavigating the globe in just 46 days. These emperors of the sky,
                while
                spend their time flying over the most beautiful vistas on this planet, embody absolute
                freedom
                and yet they also mate for life. True freedom is the ability to choose and want your choice.
                I included this because I wanted to explain why there is a bird in the design. I actually did
                all the art work for this site myself.

            <p>
                This was my final project in my coding course. The initial intent was to build a forum, like reddit, for
                posting content that was visually exciting. The user interface we settled on ended up being a sort of
                reddit, Pinterest hybrid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something important to me is effectively being able to utilize these massive bright screens that crowd
                our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s face it, Reddit is ugly. So are most
                websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things looking like children’s book everything
                stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to use because you are overwhelmed by
                options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It became a browsing/informative hybrid
                that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image they will use to get people’s attention,
                and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface. Curiosity is by its very nature hesitant, a
                website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate instinct. The UI/Design work here was my baby
                in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find it entertaining to use. Also look at the
                very informative readme on git hub to see where we intend to take the site in the future.

            <p>This project is still a bit of a skateboard. It
                was
                my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the idea that the person
                heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or
                relaxation aid. So far, we have the site receiving
                input from firebase every five second or so to slow down the sound
                of the heartbeat, because I have yet to work out the fitbit part. The app also utalizes the spotify API.

            <div class="siteTitle">NBA Sports center</div>
            <P>
                This site began as joint class project, however it has changed
                so
                much recently that it is basically almost all my work. The
                initial
                idea
                was to create a sports dashboard where NBA fans could keep up
                with
                their favorite teams and players. This was our first full stack
                project, and because of the nervousness of the others in my
                group, I
                was tasked with the entire backend as well as most all the
                communication back and forth. They just did front end design
                stuff,
                and one of the API’s that is still being utilized, although it
                has
                been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                site
                myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                responsive
                visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                information
                gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s. This project has
                by and far taken the most of my time and is the largest. I'd estimates
                my personal time spent in hours here in the 2 to 3 hundred range.
            </P>
            <p>
                Once you have signed into the site If you change the last
                integer in
                the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                not
                ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                off
                the app’s versatility.

            <div class="siteTitle">RPSLS</div>
            <p>This site was originally conceived as a game that
                would use firebase
                as a means of creating a multi-player Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
                game. So
                far, the only part I really have working is the main games logic and a
                little of
                the styling. But I am proud of the solution I came up with to make the
                game
                work. I think it showcases the way I think about solving problems as a
                programmer. This game was not part of the class curriculum I was doing
                it in my
                spare time, which began to dwindle as the course progressed. I hope to
                pick it back up when I have time. </p>

                                                        intent was to build a forum, like reddit, for
                                                        posting content that was visually exciting. The user interface
                                                        we settled on ended up being a sort of
                                                        reddit, Pinterest hybrid.

                                                        Something important to me is effectively being able to utilize
                                                        these massive bright screens that crowd
                                                        our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s
                                                        face it, Reddit is ugly. So are most
                                                        websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things
                                                        looking like children’s book everything
                                                        stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to
                                                        use because you are overwhelmed by
                                                        options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It
                                                        became a browsing/informative hybrid
                                                        that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image
                                                        they will use to get people’s attention,
                                                        and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface.
                                                        Curiosity is by its very nature hesitant, a
                                                        website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate
                                                        instinct. The UI/Design work here was my baby
                                                        in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find
                                                        it entertaining to use. Also look at the
                                                        very informative readme on git hub to see where we intend to
                                                        take the site in the future.

                                                Something important to me is effectively being able to utilize these
                                                massive bright screens that crowd
                                                our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s face it,
                                                Reddit is ugly. So are most
                                                websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things looking
                                                like children’s book everything
                                                stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to use
                                                because you are overwhelmed by
                                                options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It became
                                                a browsing/informative hybrid
                                                that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image they will
                                                use to get people’s attention,
                                                and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface. Curiosity is
                                                by its very nature hesitant, a
                                                website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate instinct. The
                                                UI/Design work here was my baby
                                                in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find it
                                                entertaining to use. Also look at the
                                                very informative readme on git hub to see where we intend to take the
                                                site in the future.

                                                my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                                                with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                                                UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                                                Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                                                almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the
                                                idea that the person
                                                heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or

                                        was
                                        my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                                        with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                                        UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                                        Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                                        almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the idea that
                                        the person
                                        heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or
                                        relaxation aid. So far, we have the site receiving
                                        input from firebase every five second or so to slow down the sound

                        Developer Story:
                    </h3>
                    <p>I am a creator. I have a bachelors in studio art. Unlike the typical studio art student, I
                        spent
                        the majority of college career studying and using many relevant technologies. I love CNC
                        machining, 3d printing, 3d modeling and 3D scanning. They allow me to take my natural gifts
                        and
                        implement them in exciting new ways. In my first sculpture class we learned how to carve
                        stone.
                        20 hours of hitting a rock with a stick pushed me into the arms of technology. I had no
                        reason
                        to code at this time, but I knew if my art could be done in a better or easier way, I was
                        not
                        about to waste my time for the sake of tradition.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the more recent past I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At
                        the
                        time they were building 3d models of homes using aerial imagery. the modeling aspect
                        combined
                        with the fact that my wife worked in the building made this job ideal. What I didn’t know
                        when I
                        took the job is that it would introduce me to a whole new world of tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have an extremely analytical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for
                        my
                        ability to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programing at a surface level. I was
                        move to the PA testing department which was a manual testing position. It was here that I
                        got to
                        interact with developers and find out what was happening behind the scenes. I realized that
                        while the testing department had more information that the rest of the PA's we were still in
                        the
                        dark about most things. Developers were talked about in reverent tones. I decided I was
                        tired of
                        being in the dark. With that, my idea for in depth comprehensive documentation of how the
                        system
                        worked was born. My intent was to give the testers enough information that they would be
                        better
                        able to pinpoint a problem after running a few tests. My team lead agreed it would be a
                        beneficial project, so I began. I started looking through confusing flow charts and reaching
                        out
                        to different departments to compile the documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p> It was fun and although I was getting praised left and right for gathering and documenting,
                        I
                        had a secret. Even though I had everyone convinced that I was just a heroic documenter, I
                        had
                        another selfish purpose entirely. I have this insatiable desire to understand things. I
                        wanted
                        to know how it worked, because I was curious.
                    </p>
                    <p> About a month and a half in, under unfortunate circumstances I was laid off with about 40 of my
                        coworkers. It was time to reevaluate.
                        But unlike when I started school, a decade before, I knew something I didn't back then;
                        coding
                        was no longer this ambiguous monster. I now knew that it was just a skill set like any
                        other.
                        Coding had been demystified. As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place, I
                        realized
                        that what I had been chasing at my job was a developer’s understanding. As soon as I could,
                        I
                        signed up for a bootcamp and got started.</p>
                    <p>
                        As it turns out, I really enjoyed learning to code and look forward to learning more. I
                        welcome
                        the added ability to create and streamline the things I value. If Michelangelo or da Vinci
                        were
                        alive today, you can bet your socks they would not be hitting rocks with sticks and mixing
                        colors on a palette. Fingers in the dirt are for enjoying a sandy beach and picking carrots,
                        not
                        for doing things as if we were born a thousand years ago. Technology makes life easier, and
                        I
                        look forward to participating in its expansion. </p>
                    <h3> Personal Crest: Albatross- symbolizes ultimate freedom.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The albatross is truly the master
                        of
                        the sea. With wings spanning up to 11 feet long, an adult albatross can travel 10,000 miles
                        in a
                        single journey and circumnavigating the globe in just 46 days. These emperors of the sky,
                        while
                        spend their time flying over the most beautiful vistas on this planet, embody absolute
                        freedom
                        and yet they also mate for life. True freedom is the ability to choose and want your choice.
                        I included this because I wanted to explain why there is a bird in the design. I actually
                        did
                        all the art work for this site myself.
