                Developer Story:
            </h3>
            <p>I grew up in Washington and moved to Utah for school. I graduated with a BA degree from BYU in 2018.
                Following my schooling, I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At the time
                they were building 3d models of homes using aerial imagery. The modeling aspect appealed to me
                creatively. But what I didn’t know when I took the job is that it would introduce me to a whole new
                world of tools.
            </p>
            <p>I have an extremely analytical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for my ability
                to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programming at a surface level. I was move to the PA
                testing department which was a manual testing position. It was here that I got to interact with
                developers and find out what was happening behind the scenes. I realized that while the testing
                department had more information that the rest of the PA's we were still in the dark about most things.
                Developers had the bulk of product knowledge. I decided I was tired of being in the dark. With that, my
                idea for in-depth comprehensive documentation of how the system worked was born. My intent was to give
                the testers enough information that they would be better able to pinpoint a problem after running a few
                tests. My team lead agreed it would be a beneficial project, so I began. I started looking through
                confusing flow charts and reaching out to different departments to compile the documentation.
            </p>
            <p> As it turns out, this project was high impact and well worth my time. Truth be told, it wasn’t something
                that I was doing because it had to be done; I was doing it because I wanted to learn. I wanted to expand
                outside of the essential duties of my job and truly understand testing documentation. I’ve always had I
                an insatiable desire to understand things and that desire has largely driven my entire life
            </p>
            <p> About a month and a half into the project, under unfortunate circumstances I was laid off with about 40
                of my coworkers. It was time to reevaluate. But unlike when I first started college, I knew something I
                didn't back then; coding was no longer this ambiguous enigma. I now knew that it was just a skill set
                like any other. Coding had been demystified. As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place, I
                realized that what I had been chasing at my job at Geomni was a developer’s understanding. With that
                revelation, I signed up for a bootcamp and got started.</p>
            <p>
                As it turns out, I really enjoyed learning to code and look forward to learning more. The bootcamp
                required consistent collaboration with other students which ultimately made me a better developer. Since
                graduating from the boot camp, I haven’t had as much opportunity to continuously collaborate with other
                developers and that’s something I would love to have in my next job. Since graduating, I have continued
                to learn and expand my portfolio and I recognize that I will only become more adept as time goes on.
                Overall, I welcome the added ability to create and streamline the things I value. Technology makes life
                easier, and I look forward to participating in its development. </p>
            <!-- <h3> Personal Crest: Albatross- symbolizes ultimate freedom.
            </h3>
            <p>
                The albatross is truly the master
                of
                the sea. With wings spanning up to 11 feet long, an adult albatross can travel 10,000 miles
                in a
                single journey and circumnavigating the globe in just 46 days. These emperors of the sky,
                while
                spend their time flying over the most beautiful vistas on this planet, embody absolute
                freedom
                and yet they also mate for life. True freedom is the ability to choose and want your choice.
                I included this because I wanted to explain why there is a bird in the design. I actually did
                all the art work for this site myself.

            <p>
                This was my final project in my coding course. The initial intent was to build a forum, like reddit, for
                posting content that was visually exciting. The user interface we settled on ended up being a sort of
                reddit, Pinterest hybrid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something important to me is effectively being able to utilize these massive bright screens that crowd
                our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s face it, Reddit is ugly. So are most
                websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things looking like children’s book everything
                stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to use because you are overwhelmed by
                options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It became a browsing/informative hybrid
                that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image they will use to get people’s attention,
                and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface. Curiosity is by its very nature hesitant, a
                website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate instinct. The UI/Design work here was my baby
                in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find it entertaining to use. Also look at the
                very informative readme on git hub to see where we intend to take the site in the future.

            <P>
                This site began as joint class project, however it has changed
                so
                much recently that it is basically almost all my work. The
                initial
                idea
                was to create a sports dashboard where NBA fans could keep up
                with
                their favorite teams and players. This was our first full stack
                project, and because of the nervousness of the others in my
                group, I
                was tasked with the entire backend as well as most all the
                communication back and forth. They just did front end design
                stuff,
                and one of the API’s that is still being utilized, although it
                has
                been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                site
                myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                responsive
                visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                information
                gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s. This project has
                by and far taken the most of my time and is the largest. I'd estimates
                my personal time spent in hours here in the 2 to 3 hundred range.
            </P>
            <p>
                Once you have signed into the site If you change the last
                integer in
                the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                not
                ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                off
                the app’s versatility.

            <p> This site is currenty underconstruction, but it is
                functional. It uses jquery, html, css,
                javascript and firebase. The game at a base level allows you to play
                against a friend through firebase as well as play against a default computer selector. Currently you can
                create
                a new User login with a unique avatar, login, see avialable
                users, request games, accept game requests and play eachother. What
                still needs to be
                done is create a logout function, I am looking into having a system that
                logs you out when you close the browser. I really enjoy
                web
                design, and this site was a
                good opportunity to learn more about css animations. I also created all
                images both buttons and avatars
                from scratch. I hope you take the time to check it out. This site is not yet available on Mobile. I

            <p>This project is still a bit of a skateboard. It
                was
                my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the idea that the person
                heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or
                relaxation aid. So far, we have the site receiving
                input from firebase every five second or so to slow down the sound
                of the heartbeat, because I have yet to work out the fitbit part. The app also utalizes the spotify API.

                I really enjoy making art. I also suffered from

                a
                healthier happier existance, I had an Idea for an piece of art that
                could
                help articulate some the principles that helped me.

                Intially This
                project was
                intended to be a sculptural. Thats what my degree is in. I was
                designing
                3D paper models that I intended to cut out and then assemble using a
                paper cutting machine. Anyways through my process I came across
                Blender.
                Blender is a open source animation software which has a python
                console.
                I realized this would be an excellent opertunity to speed up and
                stream
                line the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is quite large and the video you see here
                is just a small piece, but it demostrates my ablitity to learn new
                languages and API's. I had to teach my self python and the blender
                API
                to write this script. I hope you take a second to watch the result
                of my
                problem solving/programing skills. If it interest you check

            <p> I made my own masonary function. Its kind of cool. The images take a
                while to load and its not set up for mobile. I recomend just watching
                the
                video.</p>

                This project turned out to be a total flop, but that's alright I
                learned a
                ton. I was working on updating this portfolio for a while. I was
                creating animations in blender that synced up with scrolling.
            </p>
            <p>I was
                trying a whole bunch of different ways of going about things. One of
                the things I was trying to do was update CSS animations along side a
                video.
                My take away was that I needed to give the browser one thing to do
                at a time. I ended up just baking all of the visual elements right
                into the animation itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video shows a fun little widget I built to help line up the
                animations. While the site link will take you to the portfolio if
                your on a desktop. The scrollings is still a little chunky, and slow
                I just haven't gotten around to cleaning up the interface. It works
                though.

                I really enjoy making meditation videos and audios that provide
                wholesome entertainment. At times in my life I have had trouble getting
                going in
                the
                morning. One thing I've noticed helps is light. Anyways I wanted to
                make
                a video that simulated a gentle sunrise I could use in the winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to have the video slowly change from dark purple to yellow.
                I could not find a free video producing software that could do that.
                So I wrote this short function that takes in several colors and the
                produces hundreds of frames of color between them. The code even
                produces a video though I ended up not using that in the end. FFmeg
                doesn't have great transitions.

                                                        intent was to build a forum, like reddit, for

                                                        these massive bright screens that crowd
                                                        our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s
                                                        face it, Reddit is ugly. So are most
                                                        websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things
                                                        looking like children’s book everything
                                                        stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to
                                                        use because you are overwhelmed by
                                                        options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It
                                                        became a browsing/informative hybrid
                                                        that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image
                                                        they will use to get people’s attention,
                                                        and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface.
                                                        Curiosity is by its very nature hesitant, a
                                                        website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate
                                                        instinct. The UI/Design work here was my baby
                                                        in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find
                                                        it entertaining to use. Also look at the

                                                was
                                                my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                                                with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                                                UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                                                Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                                                almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the
                                                idea that the person
                                                heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or
                                                relaxation aid. So far, we have the site receiving
                                                input from firebase every five second or so to slow down the sound

                                        was
                                        my first frontend group project. We had not learned anything do to
                                        with backend at the time, but it showcases a fun idea and some of my
                                        UI instinct. my idea was to build an app that interfaces with a
                                        Fitbit and adjusts the sound of a drumbeat to match your heartbeat. Then
                                        almost imperceptibly the app slows the sound of the drumbeat, with the idea that
                                        the person
                                        heart rate will follow. It is intended to be sort of a like a sleep or
                                        relaxation aid. So far, we have the site receiving
                                        input from firebase every five second or so to slow down the sound
                                        of the heartbeat, because I have yet to work out the fitbit part. The app also

                                                    project was
                                                    intended to be a sculptural. Thats what my degree is in. I was
                                                    designing
                                                    3D paper models that I intended to cut out and then assemble using a
                                                    paper cutting machine. Anyways through my process I came across
                                                    Blender.
                                                    Blender is a open source animation software which has a python
                                                    console.
                                                    I realized this would be an excellent opertunity to speed up and
                                                    stream

                                                    languages and API's. I had to teach my self python and the blender
                                                    API
                                                    to write this script. I hope you take a second to watch the result

                                                ton. I was working on updating this portfolio for a while. I was
                                                creating animations in blender that synced up with scrolling.

                                            <p>I was
                                                trying a whole bunch of different ways of going about things. One of
                                                the things I was trying to do was update CSS animations along side a
                                                video.
                                                My take away was that I needed to give the browser one thing to do
                                                at a time. I ended up just baking all of the visual elements right
                                                into the animation itself.

                                                The video shows a fun little widget I built to help line up the
                                                animations. While the site link will take you to the portfolio if
                                                your on a desktop. The scrollings is still a little chunky, and slow
                                                I just haven't gotten around to cleaning up the interface. It works
                                                though.

                                                I really enjoy making meditation videos and audios that provide
                                                wholesome entertainment. At times in my life I have had trouble getting
                                                going in
                                                the
                                                morning. One thing I've noticed helps is light. Anyways I wanted to
                                                make
                                                a video that simulated a gentle sunrise I could use in the winter.

                                            <p>
                                                I wanted to have the video slowly change from dark purple to yellow.
                                                I could not find a free video producing software that could do that.
                                                So I wrote this short function that takes in several colors and the
                                                produces hundreds of frames of color between them. The code even
                                                produces a video though I ended up not using that in the end. FFmeg
                                                doesn't have great transitions.

                                        I really enjoy making meditation videos and audios that provide
                                        wholesome entertainment. At times in my life I have had trouble getting going in
                                        the
                                        morning. One thing I've noticed helps is light. Anyways I wanted to
                                        make
                                        a video that simulated a gentle sunrise I could use in the winter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I wanted to have the video slowly change from dark purple to yellow.
                                        I could not find a free video producing software that could do that.
                                        So I wrote this short function that takes in several colors and the
                                        produces hundreds of frames of color between them. The code even
                                        produces a video though I ended up not using that in the end. FFmeg
                                        doesn't have great transitions.

                        Developer Story:
                    </h3>
                    <p>I grew up in Washington and moved to Utah for school. I graduated with a BA degree from BYU in
                        2018.
                        Following my schooling, I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At
                        the time
                        they were building 3d models of homes using aerial imagery. The modeling aspect appealed to me
                        creatively. But what I didn’t know when I took the job is that it would introduce me to a whole
                        new
                        world of tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have an extremely analytical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for my
                        ability
                        to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programming at a surface level. I was move to
                        the PA
                        testing department which was a manual testing position. It was here that I got to interact with
                        developers and find out what was happening behind the scenes. I realized that while the testing
                        department had more information that the rest of the PA's we were still in the dark about most
                        things.
                        Developers had the bulk of product knowledge. I decided I was tired of being in the dark. With
                        that, my
                        idea for in-depth comprehensive documentation of how the system worked was born. My intent was
                        to give
                        the testers enough information that they would be better able to pinpoint a problem after
                        running a few
                        tests. My team lead agreed it would be a beneficial project, so I began. I started looking
                        through
                        confusing flow charts and reaching out to different departments to compile the documentation.
                    </p>
                    <p> As it turns out, this project was high impact and well worth my time. Truth be told, it wasn’t
                        something
                        that I was doing because it had to be done; I was doing it because I wanted to learn. I wanted
                        to expand
                        outside of the essential duties of my job and truly understand testing documentation. I’ve
                        always had I
                        an insatiable desire to understand things and that desire has largely driven my entire life
                    </p>
                    <p> About a month and a half into the project, under unfortunate circumstances I was laid off with
                        about 40
                        of my coworkers. It was time to reevaluate. But unlike when I first started college, I knew
                        something I
                        didn't back then; coding was no longer this ambiguous enigma. I now knew that it was just a
                        skill set
                        like any other. Coding had been demystified. As the pieces of my interests began to fall into
                        place, I
                        realized that what I had been chasing at my job at Geomni was a developer’s understanding. With
                        that
                        revelation, I signed up for a bootcamp and got started.</p>
                    <p>
                        As it turns out, I really enjoyed learning to code and look forward to learning more. The
                        bootcamp
                        required consistent collaboration with other students which ultimately made me a better
                        developer. Since
                        graduating from the boot camp, I haven’t had as much opportunity to continuously collaborate
                        with other
                        developers and that’s something I would love to have in my next job. Since graduating, I have
                        continued
                        to learn and expand my portfolio and I recognize that I will only become more adept as time goes
                        on.
                        Overall, I welcome the added ability to create and streamline the things I value. Technology
                        makes life
                        easier, and I look forward to participating in its development. </p>
